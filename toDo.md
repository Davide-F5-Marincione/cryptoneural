# To do
- (g7240) create 64 bit block cyptographic function [the method must keep working even with bigger blocks otherwise it is useless]
- (g7240) make cyptographic functions fast [at the moment those are the CPU bottleneck]
- (davide-f5-marincione) test 64 bit crypto
- (g7240) create 128 bit block cyptographic function [real criptografic function have 128bit block]
- (davide-f5-marincione) test 128 bit crypto
- (davide-f5-marincione) define a bigger network for trying to learn four round encryption [At the moment, with 32bit block and 4 rounds, it is not learning. This could be due to the underdimensioned neural networ or because the statistical correlation betwen input and output are too week. Because increasing encription rounds make the problem exponentially harder it is reasonable to scale exponentialy even the network dimension and the number of inputs. For these reason an attempt may be taken in account]
